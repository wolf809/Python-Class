Practical Python for Chandra Engineers
======================================

Practical Python for Chandra Engineers is a series of hands-on workshops and 
examples used to demonstrate and explore the capability of Python language. We
will primarily use material already available on the internet with a few 
special topic sessions. 

This documentation and these workshops are inspired by the material produced
by Tom Aldcroft et al. for the Python4Astronomers seminar given during the 
spring of 2011.
