What is Python?
---------------
- Language Features

  - Object Oriented
  - Interpreted Language
  - High-Level
  - Built in datastructures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, etc.)
  - Readable
  - Extensive Library 

- Can be run this way::

  python scriptname.py
  
- Or interactively via ipython
- `Pros and Cons <http://python4astronomers.github.com/intro/why-python.html`_
- `Executive Summary <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb.html>`_
- `Comparison to Other Mainstream Languages (circa 1997) <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons.html>`_


What can Python do?
-------------------
- String processing
- Mathematics
- Plotting
- Image processing
- Interface with the operating system
- Work with internet protocals
- Store and manipulate data
- Build and control GUIs


Ok, that's nice, what can Python really DO?
-------------------------------------------
- Build web pages
- Work with databases
- Process large amounts of text (ascii, html, etc.)
- Manage files and other system tasks
- Serve as a "glue" between compiled applications
- Communicate with hardware
- Science and Engineering Applications

  - `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

    - `Numpy for Matlab Users <http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users>`_
    
  - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
  - `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_

- `Software packages built for/with Python <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software>`_


Who uses Python?
----------------
- Google
- YouTube
- Video Game Developers
- Financial Service Providers
- Business Software Providers
- Governemnt Agencies (NASA, CIA, NSA, etc.)
- Scientists/Engineers

  - Astronomy
  - Physics
  - Biology
  - Geography
  - Weather
  - Robotics
  - Spacecraft Operations!
  
- `Python Success Stories <http://www.python.org/about/success/>`_
- Former Matlab Users

  - `One Perspective <http://stevetjoa.com/305>`_
  - `Another Perspective, using Sage (An interface to Python, somewhat similar to Matlab/Mathematica/Maple) <http://vnoel.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/bye-matlab-hello-python-thanks-sage/>`_

- The point here is that there are many first class organizations using Python, which lends credibility to Python's reliability and efficiency. 



How can I use Python?
--------------------- 


  - I suggest the Enthought distribution for first time users not using the version distributed on the FOT machines

- If you have NX installed and have VPN access to the OCC, you can run the Ska version



How can I use Python?
--------------------- 
- `Download it <http://python.org/getit/>`_
